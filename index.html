                  Going back five years ago, Lawrence had us all together and told us about his heartbeat about what God was calling him and by Gods grace 
                  he called to partner with him to achieve Gods direction, because of our history we had, our Founding faith as 
                  Christians and whatever personal reasons we may have we all agreed to be partners to create a firm that will by God's 
                  grace will be God founded and will show the light of God in an Enterprise, we had a our short term goals of 
                  starting as a tech firm with the hope of spreading our tentacles into industrial production and agriculture,
                  all these plans were made acknowledging God's divine guidance and leading.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Five years in ...five years that I would like to call challenging years for a start-up like ours 
                  considering that all most of us were students except for Ene who i think graduated three years ago. 
                  These chalenges and slow pace are not unexpected for the above stated reason among others. looking at 
                  the reality of we partners being apart due to wherever life took us to and the effect our family plays
                  in all of this and our struggle to be independent of them.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    That being said we as MountedWings cant say God has not been helping our lifes up to this point, what has been
                    happening over the last two weeks for us all and maybe way before then for some of us is evident that God is interested in us first of all as his children and he is also 
                    very interested in our progress individually to fufill our assignments as He sent us to in this heavenly race.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Personally, I wont lie God did me good this past five years if anything at all I delayed it from happening before now...but God waited
                    and He didnt give up on me, I might actually be the most imperfect one among we partners, but God waited and I can say He 
                    has started his work in my life and i wont delay him further.I cant thank God enough for bringing folks like you guys my way, IT WAS DIVINE...
                    special S/O to Ocholi, guy you mad gan lol..well I'll leave my individual goodwill message audio for each of you on the Whatsapp group..do take time out to listen to yours.
                    <br>
                    Looking at the company's short term goal which was delivering tech products and services, I could'nt help but try to 
                    learn Web design so I got to it. For a person that didnt know a thing about web design, I chose to dive in anyway.I couldnt see Francis, Lawrence and Ene sweat 
                    thier asses up without helping. my learning journey was slow and even paused at some point, my Onitsha apprentiship time out being a major
                    but the urge to be of more value to the firm brought me back to it. I cant say I'm a front-end dev yet but me being able to 
                    deliver this words to you guys on the web was deliberate..its a testimony of where God has taken me and it says alot about God has done for me and this for me its just the begining and that thougt 
                    gives me excitement.I am forever indepted to God and I'll pay him with my life. Among everything God has set before me I'LL BE A FULL-STACK DEV and I'LL LET HIS NAME BE KNOWN THROUGH MY CRAFT.

                    <h1 id="gods-lead">God's Lead for Me</h1>
                <p>The event that has played out in the last few months even though unfortunate how it played out was not a mistake, 
                    I personally hold my reservation on how it happened but I'm really thankful to God it happened this way, 
                    the past few weeks was testing time for us all and it revealed alot for me. unfortunately for stated reasons I could'nt be 
                    at the last official meeting where lawrence decided on his own to dissolve the company. Though I find the way he did that without fore knowledge of we his 
                    partners rahter too authoritative and irresponsible, I have taken it in good faith. I would want to implore Law to hasten the documented process for shutting a company
                    so I'll receive my copy to assent my closing signature more so that my home address was used as the company address so there wont be issues in the future.
                <br>
                Looking at the document Lawrence dropped for us to consider if we want to be partners in the new company, I have personally expressed my 
                displeasure and all about that with the author of the document but lemme say something here, Ive always welcomed the idea of working with friends because
                as partners we'll basically enjoy the ride into what God has planned for us. I felt being called as partners means the word "partners" anything short of it isnt partnership but 
                something else. I feel the bulk of the power/responsiblity shouldnt be on one person even to dictate how to discipline his own partners..then sack is a whole new level to the power Law gave to himself 
                and that makes me scared looking at the legal and carreer implications of that act. Knowing Law might not do that now but I dont know what each of us will become tomorrow seeing he has the sole right of sacking his fellow partners in a partnership biz.
                 Law has told me what he is trying to run isnt a company and that document will be the foundation of the new company is nothing will change
                 so even partners cant have major say in the run of the company, that also makes me scared if i am partner of a company and my say might not considered 
                 in the affairs of the company...It means i am jst an employee of the company and not a partner and co-owner
                 <br>
                 I have openly ask God for direction both for my life, my future in Him and what He wants of me in this New MountedWings.
                 <span> I regret to say I wont be part of this company anymore</span>. its been an amazing Five years with each one of you and my 
                 prayer is that we wont fall short of Godswill and mandate for our lifes, you guys are buddies for life and whenever we meet 
                 I promise I'll be more than happy to bond and catchup. I trust u guys and I know God wont let us down. Lets live Godly Lifes 
                 so we can meet in heaven where we'll ball with God for eternity in His Glory. I love yall.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Pls take out time to listen to my word for you guys on the group.
